A new project based on my work with watch-lock, with a new brand identify and a clean start after successes/pitfall with v1 of the project.

Core Goal

Enable families to share real-time reactions to sports games
even when watching at different times, without spoiling each
other.

The Problem You're Solving

Your family can't text about a game when some people are
watching live and others are 20 minutes behind on DVR. Right
now the choice is:

- Stay silent until everyone finishes (kills the fun of shared
  experience)
- Text anyway and accidentally spoil big moments (ruins the
  game for people behind)

User Stories

The Live Watcher (Dad)

"I'm watching the Cubs game live. Bottom of the 9th, bases
loadedâ€”I want to freak out to my family RIGHT NOW, but my son
is watching on delay. I want to share my reaction without
spoiling what's about to happen for him."

The Delayed Watcher (You)

"I'm watching the same game but 30 minutes behind. I want to
see my dad's reactions to the moments I'VE already seen, so I
feel like we're watching together. But I don't want to see his
messages about what happens next."

The Postgame Catch-Up (Anyone)

"The game ended hours ago, but I'm finally watching the replay.
I want to scroll through everyone's reactions as if I was
there with them, experiencing the game chronologically without
jumping ahead."

What Success Looks Like

- Small private groups (family, close friends) can create a
  room for a specific game
- Everyone updates where they are as they watch (inning,
  quarter, etc.)
- Messages flow naturally but only reveal themselves as you
  reach those moments
- The experience feels like texting but it's magically
  spoiler-safe
- Works for any sport with clear game progression (baseball,
  football, basketball)

The Emotional Payoff

You get to share the emotional highs and lows of watching
sports with people you care about, even when life schedules
don't align. It recreates the "watching together on the couch"
feeling when that's not physically possible.

It is 7:10 p.m. Oct 21 and will be making my first commit soon. But this project was originally started Oct. 8 and has gone though modifications though Oct. 20 via https://github.com/tbrown034/watch-lock. Applying lesson learned, new branding, simplified approach, better use of Supabase (this was my first time using) after other lessons learned better undertanding of docs, including useMemo as well.
